# Carry-with-U
Hi, I'm Dixit Lukhi.
I've made an e-commerce website in which user can sell, buy and delivered the products.
I've used MERN technology for building this website.
For using this website you need to run "npm install" command in both frontend and backend part. This will add node modules in your folder.
Then you nedd to run "npm start" command for run the webste in both frontend and backend part.
Thank you.
